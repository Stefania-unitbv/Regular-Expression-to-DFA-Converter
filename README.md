# Regular-Expression-to-DFA-Converter

This repository hosts a C# project that transforms a regular expression into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The application reads a regular expression from a file, validates it, and builds the corresponding DFA. It then provides a simple menu to:

Display the input regular expression.
Show the constructed automaton.
Test whether specific words are accepted by the automaton.
This project is designed for educational purposes, offering a practical demonstration of how theory meets implementation.
